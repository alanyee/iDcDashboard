This is a repository for my UCDS MS project.  I will keep a small journal of what I'm doing in this readme.

The goal of the project is to create an interactive data visualization framework within iPython to ease visual analysis of large data sets.  In particular I will connect the Pandas data frame to dc.js.

Got two way communication working.  Using set_data and set_layout on the widget will now erase the current data/layout and replace it with new values.
The displayed dashboard will be updated to account for the changes in data.

**October 14 2014**

Created python module capable of being imported into any notebook.  No longer needs modifications to the custom.js files to run (all libraries are now imported from a cdn).

**October 10 2014**

Modularized java script code.  Added JS->Python sending of filters as data is interacted with.

**October 8 2014**
Wrote a setup guide to install the java script libraries needed to run.

  Today I built a dashboard widget capable which takes configureation to create a set of cross filter backed scatter plots from a single data frame.  Basic layout controls are availible by creating new "layers", or rows of plots and controlling the size of plots.  Further extension via adding new plot types/such should be easy.

  Today I got a working scatter plot using dc/crossfilter in an iPython notebook widget.  Based on the [Handson Table Widget Example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rossant/9463955) I was able to construct a widget that sends a data frame from python -> java script cross filter, creates the dc ploting div and then renders it.  Currently it statically creates a single scatter plot with an x/y axis specified at construction time.  The notebook which demonstates this is availible on [Github](https://github.com/dlisuk/masters_project/blob/master/test_pages/Scatter%20Widget%20Test.ipynb) and viewable on [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dlisuk/masters_project/blob/master/test_pages/Scatter%20Widget%20Test.ipynb); however, nbviewer cannot display widgets so it is recomended you download the file.
  
  My next goal is to allow the construction of a more complex dashboard via a builder which will let you specify multiple plots to be backed by the data frame.

  Today I got a scatter plot working using dc.js.  Additionally I hacked around with crossfilter/dc to figure out how to add a drop down menu which lets you choose a column to use for the x/y axis of the scatter plot. I also tried to work a static scatter plot into a ipython widget but it appears I still need to understand the widget interface quite a bit better.  It is based in jQuery so my next step is to learn jQuery sufficiently to debug the problems i'm seeing.

  Today I learned about dc.js/crossfilter/d3.js.  Following tutorials from [codeproject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/693841/Making-Dashboards-with-Dc-js-Part-1-Using-Crossfil), I created a basic crossfilter data set feeding a dc/d3 visaul dash board.  Unlike our previous belief it turns out crossfilter is purely a client side data structure.  I believe that this is ok since it can be used to hold the data set locally for visaulization purposes.  
  
  Also I began looking into the widgit interface for ipython.  [This page](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rossant/9463955) contains a demo widgit for an editable pandas data frame which should serve as a useful starting point.  
  
  I created a ipython notebook based on the date widget from [this page](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Interactive%20Widgets/Custom%20Widgets.ipynb).  It shows the basic code structure needed for a basic widget.
