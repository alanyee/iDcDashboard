#IDcDashboard

A IPython notebook widget to power interactive plotting and analysis using dc.js.  Checkout the [example notebooks](https://github.com/dlisuk/iDcDashboard/tree/master/examples) and the [API Reference](https://github.com/dlisuk/iDcDashboard/blob/master/docs/api_doc.md).  Since IPython notebook widgets require an active python instance to run, the examples must be run by cloning this repository.

I also have been keeping a [progress report](https://github.com/dlisuk/iDcDashboard/blob/master/journal.md) of the development timeline.

This project constitutes my final project as a masters student at UCSD.
